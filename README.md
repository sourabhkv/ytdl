Click Launch button after downloading.<br>
You are ready to go 🚀.<br>

### Update application
Few update model were tested in past to update application.<br>
Model 1 : Manual updates with admin rights (to make changes directly in programs folder)<br>
Model 2 : Auto updates without admin rights (using `C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\Youtube-dl GUI`)<br>
Model 1 & 2 required additional component like `updater.exe` where as upcoming Model 3 no such additional component is required.<br>
Model 3 : Updater will be baked in main executable. Resulting in size reduction. ytdl will store temporary folder to store update. Each update.zip will contain script.bat to guide how changes will be made.<br>
*Model 3 is under development*<br>

This project is based on python 3.8.10. In future this may use python 3.9+ which is not supported in Windows 7.<br>

## WORKING
yt-dlp (youtube-dl for older version) searches streams available in website and displays streams.
*sometimes there may only be only video stream(s) available or no streams at all.Using VPN might help.*
User selects streams and browse location *(default location in downloads could be changed)*.
ffmpeg converts it into videos/audios.
if m4a is selected audio format ffmpeg uses AtomicParsley to write metadata in m4a file.
Pygame window displays live download progress (for older version).

## How development started and was carried?<br>
This project development started with wish to download youtube physics video(Center of mass) at 240p in March,2021 because 240p quality was managable and took decent amount of mobile data compared to 360p.
Many people don't have technical knowledge of how to use youtube-dl/yt-dlp command line, to make things easier to use (started to port yt-dlp/youtube-dl CLI to GUI) ,I thought of making GUI version of youtube-dl/yt-dlp for those having no knowledge about command line program.
Initially it was a very basic program which lack many features as time passed encountered many bugs and fixed it ,specially giving the live download progress in main window statusbar took almost 2 months to fix this  removing black console window at startup  was also challenging to fix without using `--noconsole` option.

Threading helped execute many function at same time
The function popens(cmd) never executed with object oriented programming (OOPs)
Tkinter was easy to use and took less space compared to PySide2/PyQt5
After june,2021 there was no update to youtube-dl. Development stopped for 3 months finally backend changed to yt-dlp
During this development period many bugs were encountered and fixed , many features were added ,hope this project will be active in future...
Need help to make this better so that anyone with poor internet connctivity can learn something.
